If you want to run a Bash script inside Databricks using Python code, you can use the Databricks REST API. Here's a high-level outline of the steps to do this:

1. **Authenticate**: You need to authenticate to your Databricks workspace using a Databricks personal access token or some other authentication method. You can use the `requests` library in Python to make API requests.

2. **Create a Python Script**: Write Python code to send an HTTP POST request to the Databricks Jobs API to create a job. You will need to specify the Bash script as a task in the job.

Here's an example of Python code that creates a job to run a Bash script:

```python
import requests

# Set your Databricks workspace URL and personal access token
workspace_url = "https://<databricks-instance>.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0"
token = "your-access-token"

# Define your Bash script
bash_script = """
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Databricks!"
# Add your Bash commands here
"""

# Define the job configuration
job_config = {
    "name": "Bash Job",
    "new_cluster": {
        "spark_version": "8.0.x-scala2.12",
        "node_type_id": "Standard_DS3_v2",
    },
    "tasks": [
        {
            "task_key": "bash_task",
            "notebook_task": {
                "base_parameters": {"bash_script": bash_script},
                "notebook_path": "/Users/your_username/your_notebook",
            },
        },
    ],
}

# Send the HTTP POST request to create the job
response = requests.post(
    f"{workspace_url}/jobs/create",
    headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"},
    json=job_config,
)

# Check the response for success or error
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Job created successfully.")
else:
    print("Error creating the job:", response.text)
```

Make sure to replace `<databricks-instance>`, `your-access-token`, `your_username`, and `your_notebook` with your actual Databricks instance details and notebook path.

This Python code creates a job that runs the Bash script on a Databricks cluster. You can monitor the job's status and retrieve the results using the Databricks REST API as well.
